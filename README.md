## Description
In this report, we used Python to scrape and analyze Toyota Camry used car pricing for Boston and Seattle from the "cars.com" webpage. The variables scraped from the web are ratings, reviews, prices, mileage, and year. Through correlation coefficient analysis, we found that mileage and year have a negative correlation with price. Therefore, when we use the regression model to calculate the depreciation rate of Toyota Camry in different regions, we take the mileage and year into account. The results show that Boston's depreciation rate (Age) is -695.66 and (Mileage) is -0.07. Seattle's depreciation rate (Age) is -856.88 and (Mileage): -0.03. With the value of depreciation, used car dealers have a basis for reference in the pricing of used cars, which can greatly reduce the pricing errors of different cars.<br>
In the comparison of different cities, we can find that there may be differences in demand and supply in the markets of Boston 02134 and Seattle 98107, or the pricing strategies of car dealers, resulting in an average price difference of nearly 4,000 US dollars. This analysis can help second-hand car dealers to get a general understanding of the current market situation and the market price of a specific car model before entering a new market.<br>

## Objectives
1. Analyze and compare Toyota Camry used car pricing in Boston and Seattle using "cars.com" data to understand pricing variations and help dealers set accurate prices.

2. Determine depreciation rates of Toyota Camry in each city, considering car age and mileage, to guide pricing decisions based on value depreciation over time.

3. Conduct a comparative study of used car markets in Boston and Seattle, exploring factors behind price differences and providing insights for dealers entering new markets.
